# DeepMicrobes (forked version)

NB: This is a copy of MicrobeLab/DeepMicrobes to fix the errors I faced with. Any comment or contribution to the current repository is appreciated. The following information is provided by the author of the main repository:

DeepMicrobes: taxonomic classification for metagenomics with deep learning <br>
Supplementary data for the paper under preparation is available at https://github.com/MicrobeLab/DeepMicrobes-data <br>
<b>IMPORTANT: The new DeepMicrobes (beta version) is available now. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or encounter any errors.</b>
